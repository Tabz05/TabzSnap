# TabzSnap-android-application
Social media android application.

Overview:
TabzSnap is a social media android application. Using this app,
 users can upload posts which consist of text or image or both
 and users can follow other users to see the posts uploaded by
 them. In order to upload posts and follow users, users have to
 first sign up.
 
❖ The features of this app are:-
1. Users have to sign up in order to upload posts and follow other
users.

2. While signing up, users cannot use a username or an email id
which is already present in the database, thus username and
email id are unique for every user.

3. While signing up, users may choose to upload a profile picture or
they may choose to skip the uploading of profile picture. If a user
chooses to skip the uploading of profile picture, then a default
picture serves as the user’s profile picture. (However, the user
may upload a profile picture later, by editing his/her profile).

4. Users sign in by entering their email id and password.

5. The pictures uploaded by a user along with text, if any, will be
the user’s posts.

6. Users can update their profile picture by selecting a picture from
the device.

7. When signed in, users can view their profile and they can also
view the profiles of other users who have an account on the app.

8. When users view their own profile, they have the option to delete
a specific post uploaded by them. When a post is deleted, the
page (activity) refreshes dynamically and the changes made to
the database are reflected in their profile.

9. When signed in, users can edit their profile picture.

10. Users can see a list of all the users who have an account on
the app and whom they have yet not followed (under ‘Find
people to follow’).

11. Users can see a list of all the people whom they follow.

12. A user can view a list of all the people who follow him/her.

13. Users can unfollow the users whom they follow and users can
follow the users whom they do not follow.

14. The user can see his/her posts and the posts uploaded by all
the users whom he/she follows in his/her feed.

15. While viewing the feed, users have the option to swipe down
to refresh the page (swipe-to-refresh feature), in order for
changes in the database to get reflected in the feed.

16. Users can reset their password by receiving a password reset
email.

17. While viewing the feed and profile, the back button of the
android device is disabled so that nothing happens when the
users press it. This is done in order to ensure smooth functioning
of the app. To compensate for the disabling of the back button,
buttons for smooth navigation are present in the app.

18. Users may only upload posts or follow users or edit their
profile when they have an internet connection. Thus, for activities
requiring internet connection, it is checked whether or not users
have an active internet connection (i.e. wifi or mobile network). If
not, then they are told that internet access is not available.

19. Layout and look of pages (activites) change depending upon
the state of authentication (i.e.whether or not the user is signed
in).

20. Responsive and appealing layouts.
